# Cartesian Impedance Control of Aerial_Manipulator

This paper derives a full dynamic model of UAV with a robotic arm and implements the following controlller: 
1. V. Lippiello and F. Ruggiero, Cartesian impedance control of a UAV with a robotic arm, in 10th International
IFAC Symposium on Robot Control, Dubrovnik, Croatia, Sep 2012.

A very similar control and dynamics can be found in my paper:
